            >Telemedicine refers to the remote diagnosis and treatment of
            patients through telecommunications technology. It involves the use
            of various communication tools such as video conferencing, mobile
            apps, and other digital platforms to provide healthcare services
            remotely. Telemedicine is the use of electronic information and
            communication technologies to provide and support healthcare when
            distance separates the participants. “Tele” is a Greek word meaning
            “distance” and “mederi” is a Latin word meaning “to heal”. Time
            magazine called telemedicine “healing by wire”. Although initially
            considered “futuristic” and “experimental,” telemedicine is today a
            reality and has come to stay. Telemedicine has a variety of
            applications in patient care, education, research, administration,
            and public health. Worldwide, people living in rural and remote
            areas struggle to access timely, good-quality specialty medical
            care. Residents of these areas often have substandard access to
            specialty healthcare, primarily because specialist physicians are
            more likely to be located in areas of concentrated urban population.
            Telemedicine has the potential to bridge this distance and
            facilitate healthcare in these remote areas.Telemedicine offers a
            powerful solution to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare
            providers, especially in regions like Thakalapadu. Imagine receiving
            specialist consultations from the comfort of your home, without the
            hassle of long commutes or crowded waiting rooms. This is the
            reality that telemedicine brings. By leveraging technology, patients
            can connect with doctors remotely through video conferencing or
            phone calls. This eliminates geographical barriers, allowing
            residents of Thakalapadu to access high-quality medical care
            regardless of their location. Telemedicine isn't just about
            convenience; it has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by
            facilitating timely consultations with specialists who might not be
            readily available locally. This is particularly valuable for those
            seeking specialty care or managing chronic conditions. Telemedicine
            holds immense potential to revolutionize healthcare access in
            Thakalapadu and similar areas, bringing quality healthcare closer to
            the people who need it the mos</p1

            >The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) began telemedicine in
            India in 2001 with the Telemedicine Pilot Project. In 2001,
            neurosurgeon Dr. K Ganapathy helped establish the Apollo
            Telemedicine Networking Foundation (ATNF) and Apollo Telehealth
            Services, which created the first telemedicine network between three
            institutions. In 2003–2004, ISRO deployed satellite communication
            (SATCOM) based telemedicine nodes across the country for tele
            consultation and tele-education. Telemedicine refers specifically to
            remote clinical services that focus on a curative aspect of care. It
            is practicing medicine using telecommunication technology to deliver
            care from a distance. Telehealth, on the other hand, is broader in
            scope, and includes disease prevention, digital health promotion and
            curative care. Telemedicine in India is not an overnight development
            as an outcome of Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020. With the
            cumulative effort of governments and healthcare pioneers like Dr. K
            Ganapathy and Dr. Devi Shetty, India has been experimenting with
            telemedicine since the last two decades to address the issues of
            access and availability of specialist care. 1996 - Deployment of
            first indigenously developed hospital information system software by
            Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Noida at
            Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS),
            Lucknow 1999 - Indigenous development of telemedicine technology and
            pilot deployments by the Ministry of Electronics and Information
            Technology (MeITY), Government of India (GoI) at AIIMS, New Delhi,
            Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER),
            Chandigarh and SGPGIMS, Lucknow. 2000 - Indian Space Research
            Organization's (ISRO ) telemedicine pilot project linked Chennai's
            Apollo Hospital with the Apollo rural hospital at Aragonda village
            in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. 2001 - Dr. K Ganapathy,
            a neurosurgeon regarded as the father of telemedicine in India,
            helped set up the Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation (ATNF)
            and Apollo Telehealth Services. 1st telemedicine network between 3
            institutions: AIIMS, PGIMER and SGPGIMS. 2003-04 - Deployment of
            satellite communication (SATCOM) based telemedicine nodes across the
            country by ISRO for tele-education and teleconsultation services.
            2005 - MoHFW constituted Indian task force for telemedicine 2010-
            SGPGIMS was made National Resource Centre for Telemedicine by MoHFW.
            2012- EMR/EHR Standards by Expert Group of MoHFW establishment
            2015-19 - In the five years before the Covid-19 pandemic,
            telemedicine's growth was primarily through public- private
            partnerships.
